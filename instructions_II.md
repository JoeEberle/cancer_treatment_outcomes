## Description

Welcome to the solution **Cancer Treatment Outcomes** - Analysis to achieve better patient outcomes

## Cancer Treatment Outcomes:
1. **Cancer-free** - The absence of detectable cancer cells in the body following successful treatment, indicating complete remission.
2. **Remission** - A period during which the signs and symptoms of cancer are reduced or absent. Remission can be partial (some cancer cells remain) or complete (no evidence of cancer).
3. **Ongoing treatment** - The patient continues to receive active cancer treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or immunotherapy, to control or manage the disease.
4. **Hospice** - End-of-life care provided to patients with advanced cancer who are no longer receiving curative treatment. Hospice care focuses on comfort and quality of life.
5. **Death** - The patient has succumbed to cancer or cancer-related complications.
6. **Ongoing surveillance** - Regular monitoring of cancer survivors for signs of disease recurrence or late effects of treatment, typically through medical exams, imaging tests, and blood tests.
7. **Disease progression** - The cancer has worsened or spread despite treatment, indicating treatment failure or resistance.
8. **Survivorship** - The period following cancer treatment when the patient transitions from active treatment to regular follow-up care. Survivorship focuses on maintaining physical and emotional well-being.
9. **Quality of life** - The overall well-being and satisfaction with life experienced by cancer patients, including physical, emotional, social, and functional aspects.
10. **Symptom management** - Efforts to alleviate and control cancer-related symptoms, such as pain, nausea, fatigue, and depression, to improve the patient's comfort and quality of life.
